        <h2>About</h2>
        <span>
        I hail from a southern state in India called Kerala üå¥, and I have been residing in Canada for the past few years. At Rangle, I develop web apps for a major American airline. Prior to Rangle, I worked at Bell Canada in their Field Services department, where I developed in-house projects and web applications used by technicians and control center agents in servicing Bell's end customers.

        I have spent the past 5 years in front-end development, specializing in Angular, Vue.js, and React. I worked for clients in the automotive, electronics, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications sectors. This diverse exposure allowed me to balance solutions between customer needs and user experience.

        I felt drawn towards web application development in the last years of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. Soon after graduation, I worked for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), an IT/consulting firm based in India, as a developer. I have been fortunate to work alongside many amazing co-workers, mentors, and clients who have supported me in learning and growing.
